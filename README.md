# BunnyBattle
BunnyBattle integrates zk-SNARKs to create a secure and fair version of the classic Battleship game. The project involves writing smart contracts in Solidity and using libraries like Circom and Snarkjs to implement the zk-SNARK logic. The project aims to demonstrate how zk-SNARKs can be used to ensure fairness and privacy in a decentralized environment and PvP games.
